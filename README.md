## PPSR Core Data & Metadata Standards Repsository - **NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

The following content is largely taken from the introductory chapter of Bowser A., Brenton P., Stevenson R., Newman G., Schade S., Bastin L., Parker A. and Oliver, J. (2017) “Citizen Science Association Data &Metadata Working Group: Report from CSA and Future Outlook.” Workshop Report. Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Washington, DC, 2017.

## Introduction
With the growth of citizen science comes the challenge of coordinating people, projects, and data. These challenges also present an opportunity. Through the use of data and metadata standards and other mechanisms to promote interoperability, data can support multiple research questions, allowing citizen science to help address ever-grander issues and problems on local, regional, national, and global scales.

In 2015, the U.S. Citizen Science Association (CSA) founded a Data and Metadata WG to promote collaboration in citizen science through the development and/or improvement of international standards for citizen science data and metadata. The first formal meeting of the Data and Metadata WG was held at the CitSci2017 Conference, on May 17th, 2017, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The goals of this meeting were to:
  • Convene new and existing working group members.
  • Refine the governance structure and leadership team.
  • Review the history and mission of the working group.
  • Establish an agenda for advancing the working group’s mission through projects and task forces.

This consensus document reports on the outcomes of CitSci2017 and subsequent discussions and advances the shared agenda of working group members.

## Purpose and Mission of the CSA Data and Metadata Working Group
The purpose of this working group is to develop international standards for citizen science data and metadata, with the goal of supporting inoperability and facilitating collaboration. 
Major Objectives:
  1.	Develop a formal ontology to describe citizen science, including information on citizen science project metadata, to support research on citizen science, advance practice by demonstrating data quality, and allow different project databases to share information. 
  2.	Link the citizen science ontology to relevant standards describing citizen science data sets, to support discoverability and reuse of citizen generated data.
  3.	Link the citizen science ontology and identified metadata standards to a suite of tools, technologies, and platforms that facilitate data collection and analysis to create a global network for citizen science data collection, curation, and use.  
Relationship to other working groups: The Data & Metadata Working Group will work closely with the Web/ Communications Working Group. To facilitate collaboration, three members of the web and communications working group—Greg Newman, Jennifer Shirk, and Darlene Cavalier—are proposed as members of the Data/Metadata Working Group. 

Equally important are our collaborations with working groups in ECSA and ACSA to support the collaborative development of global data and metadata standards for citizen science.

## History
During the fall of 2013, organizations supporting citizen science convened in Albuquerque, NM and Philadelphia, PA to discuss how to best share information about the growing number of citizen science, or public participation in scientific research (PPSR), projects. These early meetings were supported by the DataONE PPSR Working Group and SciStarter. Attendees represented databases of citizen science projects compiled by SciStarter, CitSci.org, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the Wilson Center. 

These organizations reached a landmark agreement - to share basic information across databases that catalog citizen science projects. The collaborative success for citizen science and PPSR led to the development of an initial PPSR-Core project metadata protocol (Appendix A). Sharing information across databases maximizes everyone’s efforts, getting more “bang for the buck” out of information about citizen science projects everywhere. It leads to current, up-to-date, synchronized project lists and promotes a broader understanding of the global practice of citizen science.

In July 2015, these partners convened at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC along with members of the growing Federal Community of Practice for Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS). As one result of the meeting, consensus was reached around seven “core” or required fields to support data sharing between SciStarter, CitSci.org, the Wilson Center’s Federal Catalog, and other databases. The July 2015 meeting also produced a list of optional and in-progress fields that still needed refinement. 

Also in July 2015, members of CSA, the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA), and the Australian Citizen Science Association (ACSA) met to discuss citizen science data standardization and interoperability at the first ACSA conference in Canberra, Australia. Members of these associations agreed that any effort to develop and promote data and metadata standards for citizen science should be global in scope. Meeting attendees also recognized that while the initial PPSR-Core data sharing protocol was developed to share information about citizen science projects, a mature version of PPSR-Core should also help organizations share citizen science datasets and data.

Members of CSA, ECSA, and ACSA jointly proposed a CSA Data and Metadata WG with these goals in mind. In November 2015, CSA formally approved the Data and Metadata WG Charter. Also around this time a memorandum4 issued by Dr. John Holdren, Director of the US White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), instructed executive branch agencies to “develop the metadata requirements” for a federal catalog of crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. This memorandum helped engage the Federal Community of Practice for Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS) in developing project metadata for an expanded version of the catalog hosted by the Wilson Center.

In 2016, the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) invited 20 international participants, including members of the three associations, to Ispra, Italy for a workshop to discuss data and service infrastructures for citizen science. Participants were asked to: 
  (1) discuss the relationships between existing databases; 
  (2) identify major requirements for interoperability between citizen science project databases, including a new database to be hosted by the European Commission; 
  (3) draft a reference model for analyzing and sharing citizen science tools and data; and, 
  (4) define a high-level roadmap with checkpoints for synchronizing ongoing activities related to standardization. This meeting led to an initial list of key projects for the working group.

As stated in our charter, the purpose of the Citizen Science Association Data and Metadata WG is to support, advance, and facilitate data interoperability among and between citizen science projects and other data repositories; and, to promote collaboration in citizen science via the development and/or improvement of international standards for data and metadata. The goals of the CSA Data & Metadata WG are to track and coordinate global efforts towards data and metadata interoperability and to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are included in these discussions.

## Rationale for Developing the PPSR-Core
Sharing information across databases maximizes everyone’s efforts, getting more “bang for the buck” out of information about citizen science projects everywhere. It leads to current, up-to-date, synchronized project lists and promotes a broader understanding of the global practice of citizen science.

## Governance structure and leadership team
As with other CSA working groups, the CSA Data and Metadata WG is led by two co-chairs. Governance over the working group is shared between the co-chairs along with liaisons to partner Citizen Science Associations, including the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) and the Australian Citizen Science Association (ACSA), and with liaisons to Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and similar groups. Together, the co-chairs and liaisons comprise the CSA Data and Metadata WG leadership team.

The work of the CSA Data and Metadata WG is supported and implemented by the leadership team and members at large. The leadership team, in consultation with members at large, is responsible for identifying bigpicture projects. The leadership team also pursues funding opportunities and coordinates across organizations to ensure that projects have sufficient support to succeed. Projects may be broken down into task forces, which have designated leaders, specific objectives, and a time frame for completion. Any member of the CSA Data and Metadata WG may propose or lead a task force.

The working group will hold an in-person meeting at each biennial CSA conference, quarterly virtual meetings, and regional meetings on an ad hoc basis. Meetings are intended to give updates on projects and task forces. Outside of meetings, virtual coordination and collaboration will be centralized through two primary platforms: 
  (1) The Member 365 platform, accessible to all CSA members; and 
  (2) Basecamp, accessible to all CSA working group members by invitation. 
The CSA website will serve as the public face of the Data and Metadata WG.

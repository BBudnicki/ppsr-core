With the growth of citizen science comes the challenge of coordinating people, projects, and data. These
challenges also present an opportunity. Through the use of data and metadata standards and other mechanisms
to promote interoperability, data can support multiple research questions, allowing citizen science to help address
ever-grander issues and problems on local, regional, national, and global scales.
In 2015, the U.S. Citizen Science Association (CSA)3 founded a Data and Metadata WG to promote collaboration
in citizen science through the development and/or improvement of international standards for citizen science data
and metadata. The first formal meeting of the Data and Metadata WG was held at the CitSci2017 Conference, on
May 17th, 2017, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The goals of this meeting were to:
• Convene new and existing working group members.
• Refine the governance structure and leadership team.
• Review the history and mission of the working group.
• Establish an agenda for advancing the working group’s mission through projects and task forces.
